    "body": "For over a decade I have worked as a physiotherapist supporting children with disabilities and developmental delays. In these years I have experienced both the magic—and the limits—of traditional methods.\n\nDuring intensive Therasuit work I spent three hours a day over two to five weeks with one child. Sometimes, despite all the effort and care, progress was slow or absent. Children told me they were doing exactly what I asked—“I am stretching my legs!”—and yet I could see their knees still slightly bent. Their frustration mirrored my own. Something was missing.\n\nCuriosity and compassion led me beyond the conventional. I discovered the book Symphony of Reflexes by Bonnie Brandes and a new dimension: the integration of primitive reflexes. In 2019 I trained in Quantum Reflex Integration (QRI) in Madrid. That changed everything.\n\nWhen I began integrating QRI into sessions the results were unmistakable. Children progressed faster—more confidently—not because they suddenly learned new skills but because tension finally eased. Cold-laser stimulation and reflex integration helped regulate the nervous system, calm cortisol and adrenaline, and unlock movement patterns already within them.\n\nToday I combine QRI with the core tools of physiotherapy: movement, exercises and gentle touch. For some children body guidance alone is enough. For others QRI is the missing piece. My goal in every case is the same: calm the nervous system so the child feels safe enough to grow.\n\nHealing begins with understanding, continues with the right tools, and unfolds in connection. That is what I bring to every session, every course, every moment of this work."
